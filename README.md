    - Instrumentalness
    - Valence
    - Time Signature
    - Duration
    - Tempo

**Technical Tools Used:**
- Technical tools such as SQL and Power BI were employed for data management and visualization. The CSV data sourced from Kaggle was transformed into SQL format for efficient analysis.

**GitHub Repository and README File:**
- This project's code, data, and documentation are hosted on a dedicated GitHub repository. The project's README file serves as a central hub for providing essential project information, including data sources, tools used, methodologies, and any specific instructions for replication or further exploration.

**Challenges Faced:**
- Import Challenges: A hurdle encountered during the project was the need for specific drivers to import the data into SQL. To address this, an online converter was utilized to successfully transform the data.

- Data Visualization Challenges: Visualizing SQL tables in Power BI presented challenges, particularly in converting numerical values into more readable and user-friendly formats. This transformation was vital for making the data accessible and comprehensible.

- Tracking Artist and Track Population: Regrettably, artist and track population were inadvertently omitted from certain analyses within categories like danceability, genre, and others. This omission highlights the importance of meticulous data tracking for future projects.

**Project Impact:**
The TikTok Popular Songs Analysis for 2020 offers a nuanced understanding of music trends, artist and track popularity, and the critical attributes influencing TikTok's music ecosystem. Despite the challenges, this analysis provides valuable insights into the factors that contributed to song success on the platform in 2020.
